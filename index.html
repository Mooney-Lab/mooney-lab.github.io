<h2>Mooney Lab @ University of Southern California </h2>
<hr>
<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:+2">Welcome! We are the Mooney Lab.</span> Our goal is to use patterns of variation in the genome 
to understand the evolutionary and population histories of both humans and other species. 
We do this by implementing and developing computational and statistical methods to study the genome.
<br>
<br>
We are also interested in more broad population genetics questions such as: 
the genomic consequences of deleterious (non-neutral) mutations, where deleterious mutations tend to aggregate in the genome, 
and understanding patterns of genomic sharing through identity-by-descent segments and runs of homozygosity.
<br>
<br>
We are located at the University of Southern California (USC) in the <a href="https://www.qcb-dornsife.usc.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Quantitative and Computational Biology (QCB)</a>.

<h2>Our Research</h2>
<hr>
<br>
For the last decade, population genetics has rapidly accelerated to new heights with the availability of sequence data.
These data sets have provided valuable insights about population history, phenotypes, disease architecture, evolution, and genomic diversity.
<br>
<img src = "LAIsoROH.jpg" width = "50%" height = "50%" style="float:left;margin:5px 15px 5px 5px;">
<br>
<br>
Broadly, our lab uses empirical data analysis, simulation frameworks, and methods development to do the following: 
1) infer the demography, 2) understand the fitness impact of recessive variation, and 3) investigate complex trait architecture.
<br>
<br>	
We focus primarily on integrating data from both human and non-human populations to develop a more complete picture of mechanisms 
that shape patterns of genomic sharing (in the form of identity-by-descent segments and runs of homozygosity) and deleterious variation. 
We are also interested in developing methods for conservation biology, inference of the genealogical histories of admixed populations, 
and the equitable inclusion of underrepresented populations in genomics.

<h2>Join the Mooney Lab</h2>
<hr>
<br>
<b>We are glad you are interested in joining us!</b>
<br><br>
I make every effort to create an inclusive lab environment where lab members not only learn the science but also are excited about the future of science. 
There are no required pre-requisites for joining the lab and lab members may come from any background. In the Mooney lab, most projects will include 
coding for genetic data analysis, some mathematics, simulation, and data visualization. Most of all, I want students to learn relevant skills for 
the next step in their career, in a lab where they feel like science is a place where they can grow and thrive.
